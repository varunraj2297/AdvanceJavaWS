The sun finally went down on a long summer’s day in Nottingham when
 Wahab Riaz and Imad Wasim stood out of their hotel peering at the crowds
  spilling out for Saturday night revelries.

A car stopped, windows slid down, a head peeped out and invectives flew out, 
followed by “what are you guys playing, we have to put our heads down and 
walk here in shame.” A Pakistani journalist restrained the players from reacting 
and shooed away the irate fan with a few choice words of his own.
