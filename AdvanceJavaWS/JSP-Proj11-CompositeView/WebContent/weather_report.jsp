The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season is officially underway, and the 
southwestern Gulf of Mexico may serve as the breeding ground for 
the next tropical depression or storm early this week.

A broad area of unsettled weather traversing across the Bay of Campeche is 
being monitored for potential tropical development.
